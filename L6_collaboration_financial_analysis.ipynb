The Trading Strategies page shows hypothetical trading results from each of the 13 technical indicators analyzed through the Barchart Opinions. Using this page, you can see hypothetical profit or loss that would have resulted following the Buy/Sell signals given by the Opinions. Each of the 13 indicators are back-tested for a period of five years, and the results are summarized for each indicator showing the total number of hypothetical trades, average days per trade and total profit or loss from the trades. The performance results of ALL the indicators are then summarized at the bottom of the page, to give you an Average Performance Summary of how the Opinions would have done over the past five years. Each of the indicators link to a page that shows the breakdown of hypothetical trades that the indicator suggested based on the Barchart Opinion. To view this information, click on any of the indicator names. Barchart Opinions Unique to Barchart.com, Opinions analyzes a stock or commodity using 13 popular analytics in short-, medium- and long-term periods. Results are interpreted as buy, sell or hold signals, each with numeric ratings and summarized with an overall percentage buy or sell rating. Each Opinion requires more than 200 active trading days to run the prices through 13 different technical indicators; for futures, the contract must have more than 100 trading days. After each calculation the program assigns a Buy, Sell or Hold value for the study, depending on where the price lies in reference to the common interpretation of the study. For example, a price above its moving average is generally considered an upward trend or a buy. The Short, Medium and Long term indicators are grouped together and calculated separately for their groups. The Performance Summary is a composite of all 13 studies listed on the page. Opinions are updated every 20 minutes throughout the day, using delayed data from the exchanges.  Barchart Symbol Notes Tutorial (8:43) Want to use this as your default charts setting?
